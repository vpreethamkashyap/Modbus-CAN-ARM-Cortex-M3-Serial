*   @brief CAN Module for Modbus.
*
*   @author Francisco Javier Guzman Jimenez, <dejavits@gmail.com>
*
*   This module is used to make a proper Modbus communication using a <b> control area network</b>(CAN), as physical layer. For such purpose,
*   it is implemented the elements and functions to establish a communication from master to one or more slaves, and vice versa.
*
*   To achieve this goal, it was used the libraries implemented by Texas Instrument, which the most important in this case is the CAN library.
*   In the proper library is implemented the basic functions to make CAN work in a "lower level", as initialisation of CAN, message objects 
*   setting up, data transfer and so on.
*
*   To understand the code is important to first understand CAN. In this case, the CAN module is compounded by 32 message object, which 
*   their function is to send or receive data according to some parameters, like some kind of mailbox. Moreover, each message sent has 
*   an ID which will be taken into account to accept the receive message in the reception, that is done by using a filter mask. So, when
*   a message is needed to be put in a message object(a message to send or a message to receive), it will be only placed into the message
*   object only if it passes the filter. In C, that function would be represented approximately by the following sentence:
*   
*   if (((OutMessage/InMessage) & MessageObjectMask) == MessageObjectID){ Message accepted and placed into the message object}
*   
*   In addition, CAN is able to use messageIDs of 11 or 29 bits. As Modbus is made to only address 247 slaves, it is only necessary 8 bits 
*   for the ID. Furthermore, to make a proper filtering it is needed to make a difference between request messages and responses messages, 
*   for that, it is used 1 bit, which will be called <b>request/answer bit</b>. Last but not least, CAN sends message of maximum 64 bits, 
*   then, if it is neeeded to send more data, it has to be splitted in chunks. Therefore, we have the next four types of messages (they 
*   will be explained later more deeply in the appropiate functions):
*
*       -00: Individual frame (data to be sent less than 64 bits)
*       -01: Beginning long frame (first chunk of data more than 64 bits)
*       -10: Continuation long frame
*       -11: End long frame (last chunk of data)
*  
*   As conclusion, 11-bits message IDs fix perfectly with our purpose and is enough. In any case, CAN is able to send other types of
*   messages as remote frames, so, in the future, if it is needed to make more differences, it can be used the 29-bits message IDs.
*   
*   The elements and functions that are explained in this module, instead of the module CAN Master or CAN Slave, are common between
*   the master and slaves, therefore, it is not needed to make a distinction and are used in the same way in both parts.
*   The functions in this module are the common ones in the master and in the slave.

*   
*   These are the elements which compound the master node and are different in the slave nodes. The first difference is that messages sent 
*   by the master will have the <b>request/answer bit set to 1</b>, for indicating a "request" and the message received will be set to 0 
*   indicating a response. That is because of the Modbus spefication.
*
*   The second important difference is that master uses timeouts. In broadcast requests, it is used to stall until is assumed that all slaves
*   received and processed the request. In unicast requests, it is used to wait for an answer, if that does not arrive, it is assumed that 
*   something was wrong and master will try to send again the request. The values of the timeouts will be explained deeply in the proper 
*   functions.
* 
*   Additionaly, to understand the code, it has to be kept in my mind that master works following the next behaviour according to the Modbus 
*   specifications:
